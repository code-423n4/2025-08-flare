🔎 **Got audit-related questions? Here's your roadmap** 

Find the information you need efficiently:

1. Step 1: **Review project documentation** in the audit repo. [Join the audit](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-08-flare-fasset) for access.
2. Step 2: Use **🤖 Docs Wolf,** C4's documentation bot assistant. Open a private thread, tag `@Docs Wolf`, and ask your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources. 
3. Step 3: If you still need clarification after reviewing the docs, feel free to **ask the Flare team** directly. From [the audit page](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-08-flare-fasset), join the audit and select the `Q & A` tab.

To ensure sponsors can focus their time on questions that truly need their expertise, please: 

- Reference what you've already checked in the docs
- Be specific about what you need clarified
- Use thread replies to keep discussions organized

Good hunting!

ℹ️ The PoC requirements have been updated for the Flare audit. The [readme](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-08-flare) has been updated with the additional bullets below:

- It is preferable to submit your PoC in Hardhat, using the test suite provided in the audit repo.
- Foundry PoCs will only be accepted if you provide instructions to run it **within the existing test suite**.
- Please check your formatting to ensure that it runs properly.

ℹ️  We've been made aware that the Immunefi report covering FAssets was published during the audit contest on **August 25 at 11:18 AM UTC**, so this has been added to the [known issues](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-08-flare?tab=readme-ov-file#automated-findings--publicly-known-issues) of the audit repo readme. Any submissions pertaining to issues identified within the report, that are received after that point, will be considered out of scope.
